##  <a name="intro"></a> :test_tube: Introduction

This is the fourth data science project done for the General Assembly Data Science Immersive program. It was executed as a group effort using [Github](https://github.com/), [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/home) and powerpoint to collaborate.

#### Problem Statement

"You just graduated from General Assembly Data Science Immersive program and managed to secure an interview with the Disease And Treatment Agency, division of Societal Cures In Epidemiology and New Creative Engineering (DATA-SCIENCE). You have been assigned into a group with other interviewees and was given a take home BI test. You will be required to work together and present as a group during the interview. Time to look at the test!

Due to the recent epidemic of West Nile Virus in the Windy City, we've had the Department of Public Health set up a surveillance and control system. We're hoping it will let us learn something from the mosquito population as we collect data over time. Pesticides are a necessary evil in the fight for public health and safety, not to mention expensive! We need to derive an effective plan to deploy pesticides throughout the city, and that is **exactly** where you come in!"

#### Stakeholders

Interviewers from the data science department. Some will be data scientists, biostatisticians and epidemiologists who will understand our models and metrics and will want more information. Others will be decision-makers, focusing almost exclusively on cost-benefit analysis.

## <a name="ds"></a> :test_tube: Datasets

There were 3 datasets given
1. Spray - Tracking the date and location where the spray occurred.
2. Weather - A huge collection of data during including, temperature, humidity, daylight hours, wind speed etc. The full documentation can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-west-nile-virus/data?select=noaa_weather_qclcd_documentation.pdf)
3. Train(and test) - The train and test datasets keep track of the traps placed, their locations, the species of mosquito found in the traps and the number of Mosquitos infected with the West Nile virus

The datasets, along with description, can be found  on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/).
