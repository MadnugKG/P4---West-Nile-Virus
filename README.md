##  :test_tube: Introduction

You just graduated from General Assembly Data Science Immersive program and managed to secure an interview with the Disease And Treatment Agency, division of Societal Cures In Epidemiology and New Creative Engineering (DATA-SCIENCE). You have been assigned into a group with other interviewees and was given a take home BI test. You will be required to work together and present as a group during the interview. Time to look at the test!

Due to the recent epidemic of West Nile Virus in the Windy City, we've had the Department of Public Health set up a surveillance and control system. We're hoping it will let us learn something from the mosquito population as we collect data over time. Pesticides are a necessary evil in the fight for public health and safety, not to mention expensive! We need to derive an effective plan to deploy pesticides throughout the city, and that is **exactly** where you come in!

This project will be executed as a group.  To make your team as effective and efficient as possible you should do the create a shared GitHub repo and project planning document as described in the deliverables section below.
